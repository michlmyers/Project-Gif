# Project-Gif


### What this project is
This project utlizies the Giphy.com API to populate still images to the browser based on an array of topics, presented as buttons, when the user clicks on one of those buttons. Aesthetically, I wanted to make it a bit tweaky and vibrant. 

When a button is clicked it will prepend 10 images to the page related to that topic. 

The user can then click on one of the still images to switch the source to the active image and the gif will animate. They can then click it again to make it still. 

The user can then enter their own search term into the form, submit it, and a new button will render on the page that reflects their search term. This newly rendered button will work in the same exact way as the buttons created by me. As will all of the images it pulls from the GIphy.com API. 

### What went into this project

This page was built at the beginning of April 2018. It represents my first work building a page that calls an API using AJAX. It uses a mix of JavaScript and jQuery for all of the action. 

### Who would enjoy this project
Hopefully people beginning to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and jQuery as well as those beginning to learn how to work with data from an API. 
It's also fun to kill some time and look at gifs. 

### Any questions?
Just reach out to me.
